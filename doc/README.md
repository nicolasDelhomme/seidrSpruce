# SRA
The SRA metadata was created using [Curse](http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Curse/index.php)

The 4 datasets are:

1. Atlas: the genome project mRNA atlas
2. Diurnal: Maria Eriksson and Marek Mutwil diurnal datasets (2 days at LD (long days) and for ME, an additional set at LL (Long Light))
3. Flakaliden: Vaughan Hurry Flakaliden experiment site. N fertilisation for 0, 5, 25 years.
4. Seasonal: Stefan Jansson seasonal data, samples collected all across the season

All the datasets consists of needles only, apart from 1. that has other tissues. These will not be considered

The datasets have been sequenced in a strand specific manner, in paired-end mode but for 1. and the MW diurnal set that were sequenced non-stranded. The latter was also sequenced as single-end only.
